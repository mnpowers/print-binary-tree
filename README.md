# print-binary-tree
I originally created the class TreeNode to play around with an implementation of a tree using a linked structure. I thought it would be useful to be able to print trees, but I quickly realized that this was more difficult than any of the algorithms I was experimenting with.

Since the code for printing is complicated, I put it in its own class, BinaryTreePrinter. The problem was to print a binary tree using only the characters 'o', '/', and '\\'. One possibility would be to print all nodes which are at a given depth on a single line. The problem is that since edges are draw with '/' or '\\', the edges become very long when this is done. So instead the program prints a tree in such a way that the number of lines used is minimized. More precisely, this number is minimized subject to the constraints that no two branches overlap, and the picture preserves the orientation of the children as they are stored in the node structure, i.e., a left child is printed to the left of a right child (we could potentially use even less lines if we are allowed to permute order of children).
